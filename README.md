# NetworkAdaptersInfo
Displays Information on Network Adapters Installed and Their Status in Real-Time -MS Visual Studio C# Windows App.

This is just a little application I put together one day to work with displaying network adapters' statuses in Windows.
It was aldo to present a different user interface - drag and drop to any place to move it onscreen, and close it by double clicking anywhere on it.
It presents a flashing effect as it closed on-purpose.
